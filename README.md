pikube is part of a DIY project aiming to demonstrate kubernetes on Raspberry Pi3.

## This project consists of ##
* Hardware: the Raspberry Pi3 and the assembly of the cluster

This is a work in progress, I'll try my best to devote as much time as possible to write it fast and have functionalities added to it.
